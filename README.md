# React/Webpack Starter

An ultra bare-bones starter for a react app with webpack dev server.

### What it includes:

* Webpack dev server
* Babel compiling + [babel-preset-env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-preset-env), which automatically determines what plugins/polyfills needed based on browser & runtime environments
* React
* Jest & Enzyme for testing

### To get started

```sh
yarn install
```

then

```sh
yarn start
```

App will be served to localhost:8080
